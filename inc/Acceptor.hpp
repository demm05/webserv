/**
 * @brief Acceptor inherent from AEventHandler  as a concrete class that accepts new client
 * connections.
 *
 * Listens on a designated port and creates new client connections when connection
 * requests arrive. Acts as a factory for client event handlers for the Reactor class - when a new
 * connection is established, it typically creates and registers a corresponding handler to manage
 * that client's subsequent communication. This implements the connection establishment phase of the
 * Reactor pattern.
