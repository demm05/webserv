/**
 * @brief Synchronous event demultiplexer that wraps Linux epoll for I/O event monitoring.
 *
 * Provides a simplified interface to the epoll system call for detecting when file
 * descriptors are ready for I/O operations without blocking. Acts as the low-level
 * event detection mechanism in the Reactor pattern implementation. By "low-level", it means
 * epoll() is a system call to communnicate with the kernal space from the user space
